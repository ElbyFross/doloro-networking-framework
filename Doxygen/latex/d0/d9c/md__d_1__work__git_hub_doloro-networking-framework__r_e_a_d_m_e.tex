It\textquotesingle{}s the framework that provide fast and easy way for creation of client and server applications powered by .Net Framework.

\section*{Scalability}

\subsubsection*{Routing tables}

Control routing between servers using easy to use {\ttfamily Routing tables} that include built-\/in filtering powered by easy to understand regular expressions.

\subsubsection*{Isolated high end logic}

Create your own high-\/end server logic to control complex custom network without demand to deep knowledge of networking backend.

\subsubsection*{Modifiable pipeline of networking logic}

Framwork provides a list of ready to use handlers that fully controll transmisssion, but you always able to create your own networking logic on every step to covering your own purposes.

{\ttfamily (Server\textbackslash{}Clent loops =$>$ Connection handler =$>$ Transmisssion handlers =$>$ Data handlers)}

\section*{Security}

\subsubsection*{R\+SA encryption of transmission}

Framework provide full A\+PI and automatic controllers for providing secure transmission of any your message. That simplify using and modification of system.

\subsubsection*{Named Pipes}

Transmission powered by named pipes that significant improve security on NT systems.

\subsubsection*{Authority Controller}

Addon that provides possibility to create users, control them\textquotesingle{}s rights. Implements tokens based rights control.

Contains built-\/in queries\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Logon
\item Logoff
\item Set token rights
\item Get guest token
\item New user
\item New user password
\item User ban
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Simplicity}

\subsubsection*{Auto R\+SA encryption}

\href{./Core/PipesProvider/Security/}{\tt Dirctory}

Client able automaticly recive a public R\+SA\textquotesingle{}s key from server and encode message beffore transmisssion. Append your client\textquotesingle{}s R\+SA\textquotesingle{}s public key in {\ttfamily pk} propery in query and server would auto encrypt answer.

Just don\textquotesingle{}t forget to set R\+S\+A\+Encryption field to true in client\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Routing table}.

\subsubsection*{Auto control of transmission}

Built-\/in networking handlers control logic loop of transmission without your involving.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Create query
\item Open {\ttfamily Transmisssion\+Line}
\item Enque query to transmission line.
\item Recive answer to your data handler in case of duplex query.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Ready to use servers}

\href{./Examples/Servers/}{\tt Dirctory}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Session provider -\/ provide tokens, control users profiles, provide complex hierarchy.
\item Queries server -\/ relay server that would receive queries and redirect to target servers by using {\ttfamily Routing tables}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{L\+SA configurator}

\href{./Core/PipesProvider/Security/}{\tt Dirctory}

Allows to configure your OS in one click relative to required rights.

\subsubsection*{Server\textquotesingle{}s built-\/in transmission algorithms}

\href{./Core/PipesProvider/Server/TransmisssionControllers/}{\tt Dirctory}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Client to Server
\item Server to Client
\item Broadcasting
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Client\textquotesingle{}s built-\/in transmission algorithms}

\href{./Core/UniformClient/Providers/PipesProvider/BaseClientPPHandlers.cs}{\tt Dirctory}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Duplex query
\item Input query
\item Output query
\item Receiving broadcast message 
\end{DoxyItemize}
